## Game Concept: Treasure Island Adventure

Create a simple treasure hunt game on Roblox where players explore a small island to find hidden treasures while overcoming obstacles and challenges.

## Game Requirements

### Core Gameplay
- Players spawn on a beach and must explore the island
- Place 10 treasure chests hidden throughout the environment
- When a player finds and touches a chest, they earn points and the chest disappears
- Display a counter showing how many treasures the player has found
- Include a timer that challenges players to find all treasures quickly

### Environment Design
- Create a small island with varied terrain (beach, forest, hills, caves)
- Include environmental obstacles like rivers, cliffs, and dense vegetation
- Design a central mountain with a special golden treasure at the peak
- Add ambient elements like birds, waves, and rustling leaves

### Gameplay Mechanics
- Basic movement controls (walking, jumping)
- A simple stamina system that decreases when running/climbing
- Include recovery items like fruits that restore stamina
- Create moving platforms and simple puzzles to reach certain areas
- Add a day/night cycle to change the game's atmosphere

### Player Progression
- Award badges for significant achievements (finding 5 treasures, reaching the mountain peak)
- Include a leaderboard showing fastest completion times
- Create different tiers of treasures with varying point values

### Additional Features
- Background music that changes based on location
- Sound effects for important actions (finding treasure, completing challenges)
- Simple visual effects for discoveries and achievements

Remember to make the game accessible, fun, and intuitive for players of all ages!
